Loaded dataset
Inpatient numbers are unique values for main dataset
however for the drug mapping, one patient can be mapped to many drugs 
2008 patients
2004 patients in the drug mapping CSV who have been assigned drugs 
One patient could be assigned more than one drug 

Removing attributes which have largely NaN values 

Columns with more than 1000 values NaN:

columns with more than 2000 values NaN:
cholinesterase- a full NULL column 

Cholinesterase was dropped- although it was a biological marker, it doesnt have any values 

Checking on Columns with more than 1500 null values to determine its usage

We don't use values of death as those medicines predicted are wrong 

we drop the column time of death.. days from admission

we are not clearing biological markers closely related to the heart even though it is more than 80% Nan

we will remove other external factors that are not felt necassary 

're.admission.time..days.from.admission.', 'time.to.emergency.department.within.6.months'
the above two columns are removed 

when assigning weights, can we use negative markers 
deleting multiple external factor columns
one hot encoding the data 

we deleted attributes ['DestinationDischarge', 'admission.ward','admission.way','occupation','discharge.department']
Height and weight deleted as BMI is present already
we convert the None value of respiratory support to NaN

DATE: 14th April 2022 

11 patients in the data set died 
we decided to remove the rows of patients who have died for now 
subsequently we delete the columns death.within.28.days, death.within.3.months, death.within.6.months

we dont need visit times so it is dropped 

I have removed the attrubutes readmission during 6 months, 3 months, 28 days,because as of now we don't have any further 
information about it to properly tell us whether or not the readmission was for another heart attack or not and this could lead 
to further misinformation for the system.

However, return to emergency departmentin te 6 months is still kept as an attribute because i am not sure 
if it may or may not be useful, even outcome during hospitalization I am not sure what to do with ALive and DIscharge against 
order as we have no further information for it 

Discharge days was also deleted 
the first 34 columns from gender are noramlised 
Respiratory support has to rechecked 

looking at respiratory support there were three readings
None
IMV - invasive mechanical ventilation
NIMV- None invasive mechanical ventilation
How important the type of ventilation is to the drug again is something i am not sure.
We need to look through the data 
and come up with important questions to ask to a doctor.
for now, i am converting respiratory support None-0 IMV-1 and NIMV-2 
I will then normalise all the data 

15th April
return to emergency department within 6 months is deleted
outcome during hospitalization is deleted 

Total number of rows in the drug dataset is 12654
the total number of unique drugs is 18
we are aiming to classify with these 18 drugs 
Spironolactone tablet                               1833
is the most commonly given tablet
Dobutamine hydrochloride injection                    22
is the least commonly given injection

for the drug data set, we can transform the dataset into unique patient values along with 18 columns of the drugs and indicate
with a 1 and 0 whether a person has had a drug or not

15th April Evening: One hot encoding done on the dataset dictionary for drug names corresponding to patient names, 
                    next step would be to delete the patients who have been discarded in the main dataset still present in drug- patient dataset
17th april:  A possible solution to the class imbalance problem, we set different weights for different categories according to the proportion of samples belonging to each category
19th april: Removed the dead people from drug and added the people who were given no drugs

23rd april:
Sorted both drug dictionary and biological indicators dataset, removed the inpatient number from both the datasets as the the rows were ordered.
Made a simple neural network and tried to fit it with the data, but it was observed that loss for each epoch was nan.
Multiple reasons for this:(In order of likelyhood)
- The dataset has nan values
- Exploding gradient problem(Happens with large data with large no of columns)
- The dataframe wasn't turned into a numpy array (2-D for main dataset)

23rd April evening:
KNN imputation was done it was found during this that body temperature.blodd.gas was completely empty and hance it was dropped as a column.
KNN imputation needs to be improved and pipelined
New methods to deal with nan values need to be looked into
First model for the neural network started working without errors although the predicted values  are ambigous
